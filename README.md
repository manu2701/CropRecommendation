# Crop Recommendation System

## üåü Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a comprehensive solution that leverages **machine learning** to predict the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil and environmental parameters. The project consists of:

- üîÆ **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using advanced algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Backend**: A Flask server for real-time predictions.
- üåê **Frontend**: A user-friendly React-based interface for interaction.

This system achieves high accuracy and aims to empower farmers and agricultural experts with data-driven crop recommendations.

## ‚ú® Key Highlights
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved an impressive accuracy of **99%**.
- **XGBoost Classifier**: Delivered robust performance with **97.5% accuracy**.
- **Logistic Regression**: Provided a strong baseline with **95% accuracy**.
- **Intuitive Web Interface**: A modern UI for seamless user interaction.
- **Real-Time Integration**: Flask backend connected to the ML model for instant recommendations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
The dataset, `Crop_recommendation.csv`, contains the following features:

### Features
1. **Nutrient Levels:**
   - `N` (Nitrogen)
   - `P` (Phosphorus)
   - `K` (Potassium)
2. **Environmental Factors:**
   - `temperature` (in ¬∞C)
   - `humidity` (percentage)
   - `ph` (pH level of the soil)
   - `rainfall` (in mm)
3. **Derived Feature:**
   - `NPK_sum` (sum of `N`, `P`, and `K`).
4. **Target Label:**
   - `label` (the recommended crop).

## üîß Tech Stack
### **Backend**
- Flask (Python)
- Joblib (Model Serialization)

### **Frontend**
- React.js
- Bootstrap (CSS Framework)

### **Machine Learning**
- Python Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`

## üöÄ System Architecture
1. **Frontend**: A React-based web app where users input soil and environmental parameters.
2. **Backend**: A Flask server that:
   - Preprocesses input data.
   - Loads the saved ML models.
   - Returns crop predictions to the frontend.
3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Pre-trained Random Forest Classifier deployed via Flask.
   - Features scaled using `StandardScaler` and encoded using `LabelEncoder`.

---

## üìä Development Workflow

### 1. **Machine Learning**
#### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values by filling numeric columns with the median.
- Add a derived feature: `NPK_sum` = `N + P + K`.
- Standardize numeric features using `StandardScaler`.

#### Model Training
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of **99%**.
- **XGBoost Classifier**: Delivered **97.5% accuracy**.
- **Logistic Regression**: Reliable baseline with **95% accuracy**.

#### Model Persistence
- `scaler.pkl`: StandardScaler for feature scaling.
- `label_encoder.pkl`: LabelEncoder for crop labels.
- `random_forest.pkl`: Trained Random Forest model.

### 2. **Backend Development**
- **Flask API Endpoints:**
  - `/predict`: Accepts JSON input, preprocesses it, and returns the recommended crop.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error messages for invalid input or server issues.

### 3. **Frontend Development**
- Built with React.js for a modern, responsive UI.
- Form for user input and real-time display of predictions.
- Styled with Bootstrap for a clean, professional look.
